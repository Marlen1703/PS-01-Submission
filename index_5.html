No more champagne
<br>And the fireworks are through
<br>Here we are, me and you
<br>Feeling lost and feeling blue
<br>It's the end of the party
<br>And the morning seems so grey
<br>So unlike yesterday
<br>Now's the time for us to say...
<br>Happy new year
<br>Happy new year
<br>May we all have a vision now and then
<br>Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
<br>Happy new year
<br>Happy new year
<br>May we all have our hopes, our will to try
<br>If we don't we might as well lay down and die
<br>You and I
